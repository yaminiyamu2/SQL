*** Creating a View:
    -----------------
Views in SQL are kind of virtual tables. A view also has rows and columns as they are in a  real table in the database. 
We can create a view by selecting ﬁelds from one or more tables  present in the database. 
A View can either have all the rows of a table or speciﬁc rows  based on certain condition.
Syntax:
CREATE VIEW view_name AS  SELECT column1, column2.....  FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
view_name: Name for the View  table_name: Name of the table  condition: Condition to select rows

***Deleting a view:
   ----------------
We have learned about creating a View, but what if a created View is not needed any  more? Obviously we will want to delete it. 
SQL allows us to delete an existing View. We  can delete or drop a View using the DROP statement.
Syntax:
DROP VIEW view_name;
Example:
DROP VIEW [Brazil Customers];

***Update a View:
   ---------------
There are certain conditions needed to be satisﬁed to update a view. If any one of these  conditions is not met, 
then we will not be allowed to update the view.
Syntax:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS  SELECT column1, column2, ..
FROM table_name  WHERE condition;
Example
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS  SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, City
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
