SQL JOINS are used to retrieve data from multiple tables. A SQL JOIN is  performed when two or more tables are combined in a SQL statement.
There are 4 diﬀerent types of SQL joins:
SQL INNER JOIN (sometimes called simple join)
SQL LEFT OUTER JOIN (sometimes called LEFT JOIN)
SQL RIGHT OUTER JOIN (sometimes called RIGHT JOIN)
SQL FULL OUTER JOIN (sometimes called FULL JOIN)

***SQL INNER JOIN (simple join):
   -----------------------------
It is the most common type of SQL join. SQL INNER JOINS return all rows from multiple  tables where the join condition is met.
Syntax:
The syntax for the INNER JOIN in SQL is:
SELECT columns FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.cloumn=table2.column;

***SQL LEFT OUTER JOIN:
   ------------------------
Another type of join is called a LEFT OUTER JOIN. This type of join returns all rows  from the LEFT-hand table speciﬁed in the ON condition 
and only those rows from the other table where the joined ﬁelds are equal (join condition is met).
Syntax:
The syntax for the LEFT OUTER JOIN in SQL is:
SELECT columns FROM table1 LEFT OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column=table2.column;

***SQL RIGHT OUTER JOIN:
   ---------------------
Another type of join is called a SQL RIGHT OUTER JOIN. This type of join returns all  rows from the RIGHT-hand table speciﬁed in the ON condition
and only those rows from the other table where the joined ﬁelds are equal (join condition is met).
Syntax:
The syntax for the RIGHT OUTER JOIN in SQL is:
SELECT columns FROM table1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column=table2.column;

***SQL FULL OUTER JOIN:
   ---------------------
Another type of join is called a SQL FULL OUTER JOIN. This type of join returns  all rows from the LEFT-hand table and RIGHT-hand table
with NULL values in  place where the join condition is not met.
Syntax:
The syntax for the SQL FULL OUTER JOIN is:
SELECT columns FROM table1 FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column=table2.column;
