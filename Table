*****Temporary Tables:
     ------------------
Temporary tables are stored in tempdb. They work like a regular table in that you  can perform the operations select, insert and delete as for a regular table.
They are speciﬁed with the preﬁx #, for example #table_name  There are 2 Types of Temporary Tables:
1 . Local Temporary Tables
2. Global Temporary Tables

1.Local Temporary Tables:
Local temporary tables are the tables stored in tempdb. Local temporary tables are  temporary tables that are available only to the session that created them.
Syntax:
create table
#table name
(
column_name varchar(20)
column_no int
)

2.Global Temporary Table:
Global temporary tables are also stored in tempdb. Global temporary tables are  temporary tables that are available to all sessions and all users.
They are speciﬁed  with the preﬁx #, for example ##table_name.
Syntax
create table ##table_name
(
column_name varchar(20)
column_no int
)

***SUB QUERY:
   ----------
A subquery is a SQL query nested inside a larger query.
->A subquery may occur in : SELECT, FROM, WHERE Clause
->The subquery can be nested inside a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE  statement or inside another subquery.
->A subquery is usually added within the WHERE Clause of another SQL SELECT  statement.
->You can use the comparison operators, such as >, <, or =. The comparison operator  can also be a multiple-row operator, such as IN, ANY, or ALL.
Type of Subqueries
1.Single row subquery : Returns zero or one row.
2.Multiple row subquery : Returns one or more rows.
3.Multiple column subqueries : Returns one or more columns.
4.Correlated subqueries : Reference one or more columns in the outer SQL statement.  The subquery is known as a correlated subquery because the subquery is related to  the outer SQL statement.
5.Nested subqueries : Subqueries are placed within another subquery.
